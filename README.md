# 🧠 Mood Tracker – A React Hooks Mastery Project

Welcome to the **Mood Tracker App**, a feature-rich project built using modern React concepts. This application allows users to log their moods, persist them using localStorage, and toggle between dark/light themes — all while showcasing a deep understanding of **React Hooks**, **state management**, and **custom logic abstraction**.

---

## 📖 About This Project

This app was created as a **React Hooks capstone project** to demonstrate hands-on expertise with:

- State management using `useState` and `useReducer`
- Side-effects with `useEffect`
- DOM references via `useRef`
- Theming with React `Context API`
- Custom hooks to encapsulate logic (`useLocalStorage`)
- Clean and scalable component architecture

Whether you're a recruiter assessing developer skill or a fellow React dev looking for practical guidance — this project is a hands-on resource for learning or hiring.
